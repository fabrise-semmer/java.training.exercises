Create a program FindAverage that takes four command line integers.

The first three are integers to be add to an Pojo, Average, with a List of integers.
The last command line, is the value to do the division of list of integers. 
Add the value on Pojo as average.

The propose of the program is to find the average of the List of integers.
So:
	- adding a integers to the list;
	- getAllListOfIntegers;
	- apply the sum of integers with the division of the average;
