Create a singleton ShopList of lazy type. This singleton stores the list of shops (as string).

        Implement the following functionalities:
        - adding a shoplist to the list:
        - a method adding the item to the list should return boolean ( true if the item has been
        added to the list, false if itâ€™s otherwise );
        -
        - adding a duplicated name is impossible;
        - get a list of ShopList, that names start from Food;
        - get a list of ShopList, that names start from Other;
